### Overview

Used as a visual cue to indicate information being loaded on to the screen or to communicate that the system is processing information.
The spinner is a load indicator that displays whenever an application is processing or waiting for an operation. While the spinner is loading, you cannot interact with the target until the process is completed.

### Anatomy

1. **Icon:**Â Indicates the loading action; it is available in either a medium (md) or large (lg) size

---

### Size

Loaders are available in 3 sizes: small (sm), medium (md) and large (lg).

Choose a size based on your design and use case.

### Medium

Use a medium loader to indicate when content is loading within smaller areas, such as panels, modals, and form controls. They are also ideal for areas with limited space.

Avoid using this size when labels and actions are used together.

### Large

Use a large loader to indicate when content is loading within larger areas, such as full-page views, large panels, and modals. They're also ideal for any areas that don't have space constraints.

### UI Text Guidelines

Consider the following recommendations when using text with a loader:

- Labels should be helpful and contextual.
- All labels should be in sentence case, with the exception of proper nouns.

---

### Usage

Use a loading spinner whenever the wait time is anticipated to be longer than three seconds.

Use a button loader for actions triggered by a button.

### Loaders with only an icon

If no context is needed, you can provide only an icon to show the loading process.

### Loaders with a description

This configuration includes a description that tells the user what content is currently loading.
