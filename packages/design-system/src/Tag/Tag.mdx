### Success

<Canvas of={TagStories.SuccessTag} />

### Warning
Indicate that something is working, but might cause issues later. Can also mark an action that is not recommended, or is expected to lead to an error down the line. E.g. “Expiring”.
<Canvas of={TagStories.WarningTag} />

### Error
Indicate that something is not working as expected. Can also mark an action that is broken or will break some functionality immediately. E.g. "Expired".
<Canvas of={TagStories.ErrorTag} />

### Info
For general use. Any tag that provides neutral information, or does not fit into one of the other categories falls here.
<Canvas of={TagStories.InfoTag} />

### Special

<Canvas of={TagStories.SpecialTag} />

### Premium

## Removing tags
Tags can be permanent or closable (by displaying the close icon). The `isClosable` prop enables users to actively remove any tag and is frequently utilized in filtering.

<Canvas of={TagStories.TagCloseStory} />

## Usage

- Use sentence case for writing labels.
- Keep labels short to prevent wrapping, typically one or two words.
- Avoid overloading an interface with tags as it reduces their meaning and makes them easier to overlook.
