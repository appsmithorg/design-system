### Tag

Use tags to categorize items with descriptive keywords.

Tags can be single or multiple and used to categorize items.

Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to differentiate it.

### Types

Display tags are used to quickly and conveniently display category labels to the user. They are commonly used to show labels, categories, or active filters.

### **Anatomy**

**Removing tags**

1. Tags can be permanent or removable (by displaying the remove icon). The "dismissible" attribute enables users to actively remove any tag and is frequently utilized in filtering.
2. The tags are displayed in a multi-select input with a dismissible icon.

### General Guidelines

- Use sentence case for writing labels.
- Keep labels short to prevent wrapping.
- Avoid overloading an interface with tags as it reduces their meaning and makes them easier to overlook.
