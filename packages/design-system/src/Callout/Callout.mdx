### Usage

****When to use****

****

Notifications are an effective way to communicate with users and provide immediate feedback, but they can also be disruptive if used excessively. Therefore, it's important to use notifications only when necessary, such as when there's an update or change to the system status.

To make notifications less disruptive, it's important to keep them short and to the point. Use clear and concise language to communicate the necessary information to the user. Additionally, it's important to consider the timing and frequency of notifications. Avoid sending too many notifications at once or at inconvenient times, such as late at night or early in the morning.

By using notifications responsibly, you can effectively communicate with your users while also minimizing the disruption to their workflow.

**Sizing**

Inline notifications' width varies based on content and layout. They can expand to fill the container or content area and their height is based on the length of the content, which should not exceed two lines.

**Placement**

They appear close to related items, aligning to grid columns and expanding to fill the width of their container or content area.

**Dismissal**

Inline notifications remain on the page until dismissed or resolved by the user.

To dismiss inline notifications, click the small "x" in the top right corner. Only include the close button if it is not critical for a user to read or interact with the notification.
