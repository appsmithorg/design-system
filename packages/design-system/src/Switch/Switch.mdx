# Switch

A toggle switch is used to quickly switch between two possible states. They are commonly used for “on/off” functionality.

### Usage

- Toggle switches are typically used when users need to turn a single option on or off, such as enabling or disabling a feature.
- Toggle switches are often used for binary settings, where there are only two options, such as "On/Off," "Yes/No," or "Enable/Disable.
- Toggle switches provide an immediate visual indication of the current state of the option, as they have a clear "on" or "off" position.
- Toggle switches usually do not require an additional "Submit" or "Apply" button, as the changes are applied immediately when the user toggles the switch.
