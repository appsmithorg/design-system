Overview

The number input allows users to enter a numeric value, increase or decrease it using a two-segment control (+ / -).

### Anatomy

1. **Label**: Clearly identifies the purpose of the input field and informs the user about the expected content. It is mandatory unless there is an approved accessibility exemption.
2. **Numeric value**: The value that is entered or modified by the user in the field, either through direct input or using the subtract or add controls.
3. **Field**: The designated area where users can input or modify data.
4. **Subtract icon**: An icon or control that allows the user to decrease or subtract values.
5. **Add icon**: An icon or control that enables the user to increase or add values.

### Usage

Number Input:

- The number input allows users to enter a numeric value.
- It provides a two-segment control that allows users to incrementally increase or decrease the value.
- Number inputs are specifically designed for specifying numeric values and are similar to text inputs in functionality.
- They offer a convenient way to adjust small values, reducing input efforts for users.

When to use Number Input:

1. When the user needs to input a numeric value.
2. When adjusting small values with a few clicks is sufficient.
3. When users want to change values relative to their current state and don't require exact values.

When not to use Number Input:

1. Avoid using number input for large value changes. For instance, when the value range is extensive, such as 1 to 30, it may require excessive clicks to reach the desired value. In such cases, consider using a slider for large or wide range numeric options.
2. For continuous variables, it is best to avoid number inputs. If it is crucial to specify the exact value within a broad range, consider using a text input instead.
