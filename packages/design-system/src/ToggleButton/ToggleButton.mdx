### Overview

Toggle buttons are a common user interface element used for boolean actions. They are particularly useful for representing and toggling between two binary states, such as on/off, enable/disable, or true/false. Toggle buttons visually indicate the current state and provide users with a simple way to switch between the two options. The appearance of the button typically changes to reflect the active state, providing instant visual feedback to the user.

### States

- Default State
- Hover State
- Active State
- Active Hover

### Usage:

**Use a Toggle Button when:**

- You have two options or states that are mutually exclusive.
- Instant visual feedback is needed to indicate the selected option.
- The options have equal importance and need to be switched frequently.

---

**Use a General Button when:**

- You have a single action or command to perform.
- The action does not involve toggling or switching states.
- Additional customization or functionality is required.

In summary, choose a Toggle Button for mutually exclusive options with instant feedback and equal importance. Choose a General Button for single actions or when customization is needed. Consider the specific context and user needs when deciding which button type to use.
