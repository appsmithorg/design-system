# Checkbox

Checkboxes are form based elements. They require an explicit confirmation (usually  via a save or a submit button) for their values to be stored. The result of the action should be communicated to the user.
Checkboxes allow users to select multiple options from a group. When using checkboxes, ensure clear and accurate labeling to convey the meaning of each checkbox. Provide feedback to users when a checkbox is selected or deselected, such as displaying a message. Avoid using an excessive number of checkboxes on a single page to prevent overwhelming the user with excessive options.

### Usage

****When to use****

- To present multiple options that can each be selected.
- For changes that require confirmation after selection.

****When not to use****

- When only one of multiple options can be selected—use a **radio**.
- You want to group multiple options together into a single basic choice—use a **radio group.**
- For single on/off settings with an instant response—use a **switch**.
- Limited space: When there is limited space available for options or when the list of options is lengthy, checkboxes may not be the best choice. [Select](https://www.notion.so/Select-347c0988903d4addb5224f2a1bb36c8e?pvs=21) may be more space-efficient.

## Content guidelines
