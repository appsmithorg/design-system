### **Kind**

Image, Initials,

### Size

Small 24px, Medium 32px

## **Fallbacks**

In case there is an error loading the avatar image, the component will fallback to an alternative option in the following order:

- The first letter of the `alt` text
- A generic avatar icon

*(To check if possible)*

As the avatar is a visual representation of a user or entity. Make sure there’s an alt text equivalent included.

### **Initials**

If there is no image available, use a person's initials instead.

## Avatar Group

**Avatar group:** 
An avatar group is a collection of avatars that are displayed stacked on top of each other.

Stacked groups are limited to five avatars and should only be used with medium or small avatars.
