### Usage

- Segmented controls can be used for single or multiple choices, such as in the Property Pane where only one segment can be selected for position options.
- Segmented controls are ideal for large groups of content, unlike toggles which are typically used for binary decisions.
- Limit the number of segments to around five in a wide interface.
- It's generally best to keep the size of segments consistent, including icon and title widths, to maintain a balanced appearance.

Avoid using more than five control as provided in the component. Instead, consider using a [select component](https://www.notion.so/Select-347c0988903d4addb5224f2a1bb36c8e?pvs=21).

## Content guidelines

### Text label

- Be concise and specific and limit text labels to one to three words.
- Text labels should clearly communicate the view users will see and the content contained in the view.
