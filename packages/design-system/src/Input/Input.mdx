# Input

An input element primarily contains a text field that enables users to input or edit text in a user interface.
Text fields are typically used within forms but can also be incorporated into modals, search bars, or cards. Examples of common text input types include usernames, descriptions, URLs, emails, addresses, and plain text searches.

## Anatomy

1. **Label:** Descriptive text that identifies the input field and indicates what type of information is expected or what action should be performed.
2. **Placeholder text:** Optional text that can be displayed within the input field as a hint or example of the expected input format. Do not rely on this method as the only hint because placeholder text disappears once users start typing in the field. Well thought out placeholder text is a good flavour and adds to the polish of the product, but for formatting and other nudges always use the description as well.
3. **Input area:** This is where people enter text.
4. **Description:** Use the helper text to communicate more information about how to fill the input field or to communicate additional information about input fields state.
