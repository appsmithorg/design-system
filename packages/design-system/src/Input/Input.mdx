### Overview

A text field is an input element that enables users to input or edit text in a user interface.

Text fields are typically used within forms but can also be incorporated into modals, search bars, or cards. Examples of common text input types include usernames, descriptions, URLs, emails, addresses, and plain text searches.

1. **Label:** Descriptive text that identifies the input field and indicates what type of information is expected or what action should be performed. It is typically positioned above.
2. **Placeholder text:** Optional text that can be displayed within the input field as a hint or example of the expected input format. Placeholder text disappears once users start typing in the field.
3. **Input area:** This is where people enter text.
4. **Helper text:** Additional text that provides guidance or clarification about the input field. This can be placed outside of the input field, near the label

### Content guidelines

Place helper text outside of the input area, with examples or syntax for clarity after text entry. Keep field label text concise above the input area and avoid excessive use of helper text.
