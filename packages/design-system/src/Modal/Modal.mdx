1. **Header:** Text title accompanied by a close button
2. **Content slot:** Container for the main content of the modal; the content can be text, forms, lists, cards, or other elements.
3. **"Close" action**: Iconic button for exiting the modal
4. **Footer:** Container for buttons related to the content of the modal

### Confirmation

Use a modal to confirm irreversible actions and prevent mistakes. This is particularly helpful when a user is about to make a decision that has permanent consequences, such as deleting important data or cancelling a subscription.

Use a main button to indicate if the user should proceed or not, and a secondary button to cancel the action.

### Usage

A modal can be used in various contexts and to display a variety of information.

### **When to use**

- Use a modal when you need to display content that temporarily blocks interactions with the main view of an application.
- Use a modal when you need to ask for confirmation from a user before proceeding.
- Use a modal when the user needs to take critical or non-reversible actions

### **When not to use**

- For non-essential information that is not related to the current user flow.
- When the modal requires additional information, which is unavailable within the modal itself, for decision making.

---

To ensure users have a way to close a modal, consider implementing one or more of the following options:

- **Cancel button**
- **Close button**
- **Escape key**
- **Clicking outside of the window**
