# Overview

Tabs are a highly useful feature that can help users quickly navigate through a website or application. By grouping related information together, tabs allow users to easily find the information they need without having to search for it.

Tabs can help to make a website or application feel more organized and intuitive to use, which can lead to increased user satisfaction. Overall, the use of tabs is a great way to improve the user experience and make it easier for users to engage with your content.

## Usage

- Avoid using more than five tabs in a tab list or segment control. Instead, consider using a [select component](https://www.notion.so/Select-347c0988903d4addb5224f2a1bb36c8e?pvs=21).
- Keep in mind that the number of tabs listed in the properties is the maximum limit and should not be exceeded.
- Avoid removing or detaching tabs to accommodate this limit.
- For navigation purposes, avoid using multiple tabs in the same container and instead use segmented controls for secondary-level navigation.

### Content guidelines

Make sure each tab has a clear and concise label that describes its content. Also, categorize each tab's content independently and make sure it does not overlap with the content of other tabs.
