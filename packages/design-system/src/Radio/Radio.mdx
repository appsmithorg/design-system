# Radio

A radio input is used to allow users to select only one option from a group of choices. It is typically displayed as a part of a radio group, where only one option can be selected at a time.


## Anatomy

1. **Radio**: The selection control.
2. **Radio label**: Text label associated with the checkbox

### Best Practice

- Use a radio group with a "None" option for an unselected state.
- Set a default option in the radio group.

### When not to use

â€¢ Use checkboxes when users need to select multiple options.

## Content guidelines

**Group labels (optional)**

- Use headings to provide context or clarity for a set of radio buttons.
- Avoid redundant group labels for radio buttons if they are already part of a larger group of components with a group label.
- Use sentence case for group labels.

**Radio button labels**

- Ensure clear and concise labels for radio buttons.
- Position labels to the right of radio button inputs.
